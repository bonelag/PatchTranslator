Game text translation toolkit for Windows with HOOK/OCR/Clipboard input, multi-engine translation, TTS, dictionary integration, and rich UI customization.

## Project Status

- Status: Active development
- Platform: Windows (Win10/11 recommended)
- Legacy targets: Win7 / XP compatibility builds (limited)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions build + release pipeline

## App Info

| Item | Value |
| - | - |

## Download

- Main download portal: https://lunatranslator.org
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/bonelag/PatchTranslator/releases

Recommended build:
- Windows 10/11 x64

## Quick Start

1. Download and extract to a writable folder (for example `D:\Apps\LunaTranslator`).
2. Start `LunaTranslator.exe`.
3. Select text source (HOOK/OCR/Clipboard).
4. Enable translation engines and set target language.

> Avoid protected directories such as `C:\Program Files` to prevent config/cache permission issues.

## Security / Antivirus Note

HOOK mode uses DLL injection into target processes. Some antivirus products may flag these binaries.

If files are quarantined:
1. Add the LunaTranslator folder to antivirus exclusions.
2. Re-download and re-extract.

Builds are generated by GitHub Actions:
- https://github.com/bonelag/PatchTranslator/actions

## Troubleshooting

- Missing embedded Python/components:
	- usually caused by antivirus quarantine
	- add exclusion and re-extract package
- `PermissionError`:
	- move app out of protected directories
- HOOK cannot attach:
	- try `LunaTranslator_admin.exe`
	- check game anti-cheat / process privilege level
